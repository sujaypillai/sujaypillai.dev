      <description>The steps below in this blog will help you setup Kubernetes Metrics Server on Docker Desktop which provides a standalone instance of Kubernetes running as a Docker container.
Kubernetes Metrics Server is a scalable, efficient source of container resource metrics for Kubernetes built-in autoscaling pipelines. Metrics Server collects resource metrics from Kubelets and exposes them in Kubernetes apiserver through Metrics API for use by Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Vertical Pod Autoscaler.</description>

      <description>If you are looking for how to get started with Azure Data Factory (ADF), I will definitely recommend you to go through Cathrine Wilhelmsen&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; Beginner’s Guide to Azure Data Factory. It helped me to understand the basics for ADF before starting work on a project I recently had a chance to participate at my workplace.
The compute infrastructure that is required by ADF provides the following data integration capabilities across different network environment:</description>

      <description>Last week Docker released its first Github Action called docker/build-push-action . This has been developed by Docker after keeping into consideration to simplify basic workflow of: building an image, tagging it, logging into Docker Hub, and pushing the image to a registry.
My previous blog Docker images on Github Package Registry showcased how we could achieve the above workflow with Github package registry. If you look at the workflow definition dockerimage.</description>

      <description>This post basically highlights how you can setup your blogging site (or any static website) using Hugo running in a Docker Swarm environment with Traefik. This whole setup is done on AWS, but it could be replicated to any cloud service provider. In my case its only a single node docker swarm cluster.

      <description>Ever wondered to have your source code and packages in one place?
GitHub Package Registry is a package management service that makes it easy to publish public or private packages next to your source code. It is fully integrated with GitHub, so you can use the same search, browsing, and management tools to find and publish packages as you do for your repositories. You can also use the same user and team permissions to manage code and packages together.</description>

      <description>One of the cool feature released with Docker 18.09 is the ability to connect to a docker daemon over ssh. This post would walk you through the steps to connect to a docker daemon running on DigitalOcean.
To create a remote docker host we will use a tool called docker-machine :
1  docker-machine create --driver DigitalOcean --digitalocean-access-token xxxx do-node2   Here is a detailed documentation about setting up a droplet on DigitalOcean.</description>

      <description>ARG a.k.a &amp;ldquo;build-time variable&amp;rdquo; can be used to pass a variable to builder with the docker build command using --build-arg &amp;lt;varname&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt; flag
 With the new engine 18.09 Docker supports a new backend BuildKit for executing your builds. You may switch to this backend by setting the below environment variable on your CLI -
1  DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1   With this new backend Docker predefines a set of ARG variables with the information pertaining to the platform of the node performing the build (build platform) and the resulting image (target platform)</description>

      <description>If you are using Docker for Windows there might be a need to switch between Linux OR Windows container at times.
The first way to achieve this is to right click on the whale icon from the system tray and choose either the option &amp;ldquo;Switch to Linux Containers&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; OR &amp;ldquo;Switch to Windows Containers&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
The other way to achieve this from the CMD/Powershell is to execute the below command:  &amp;amp; &#39;C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.</description>

      <description>If you are using latest Docker for Windows 18.02 CE Edge or higher it comes by default Docker Orchestrator as &amp;ldquo;Kubernetes&amp;rdquo;. For me at the time of writing this post I don&amp;rsquo;t see an option to switch it to Docker Swarm from the Settings menu.
If you ever need to change the Orchestrator to Swarm/Kubernetes you may set the environment variable DOCKER_ORCHESTRATOR to appropriate value as shown below
1  set DOCKER_ORCHESTRATOR=swarm   </description>

      <description>If you look into the Email Form while setting an &amp;ldquo;Send Email&amp;rdquo; Action on a folder you would be wondering how we can add new email templates into the list of drop down &amp;ldquo;Use Template&amp;rdquo; as shown below -
The only option without any customization is to add your templates into the folder : Repository &amp;gt; Data Dictionary &amp;gt; Email Templates &amp;gt; Notify Email Templates
How does this work? Look for the bean &amp;lsquo;ac-email-templates&amp;rsquo; in alfresco/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/action-services-context.</description>

      <description>Inspired from Chris Paul&amp;rsquo;s blog and work I was reading about Alfresco Global Virtual Hack-a-thon scheduled to be on 17th April 2015 and going through the list of Projects came across - Document Checksuming and display in Share. My bookmark&amp;rsquo;s collection had Chris&amp;rsquo;s blog and thought of bootstrapping myself for hackathon by rewriting the whole work done by Chris using Alfresco SDK 2.0 on 5.0.c.
Below are the brief details about my approach:</description>
