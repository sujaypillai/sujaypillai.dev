This post basically highlights how you can setup your blogging site (or any static website) using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) running in a Docker Swarm environment with [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/). This whole setup is done on AWS, but it could be replicated to any cloud service provider.
